This library is still in early development, so API changes are a regular
occurrance. For this reason, using the library at this stage is not yet
recommended.

- Sprite, mesh, and font rendering
- Camera/Transform handling
- Audio preloading, streaming, and playback
- Post-processing system
- Unified keyboard and mouse input
- Basic event/delegates implementation
